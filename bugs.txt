Bugs and Issues Analysis
1. Duplicate Wallet Entries Issue
Problem:

The system allows multiple wallet entries for the same user, causing duplicate records in the database.
This leads to users appearing multiple times in the Users & KYC page in the admin panel.
Evidence:

The existence of fix-duplicate-kyc-entries.sql indicates this is a known issue.
The SQL file contains logic to remove duplicate wallet entries and add a unique constraint.
Solution:

Execute the fix-duplicate-kyc-entries.sql script to clean up existing duplicates.
Add a unique constraint on the user_id column in the wallets table to prevent future duplicates.
Update the user_wallet_summary view to use DISTINCT ON to handle any edge cases.
2. Wallet Balance Calculation Inconsistency
Problem:

There are inconsistencies between the calculated wallet balance and the stored wallet balance.
The calculation logic is duplicated in multiple places (WalletTab.tsx and wallet-utils.ts) with slight differences.
Evidence:

In WalletTab.tsx, there's a complex calculation for earnings that updates the wallet in the database.
In wallet-utils.ts, there's a separate calculation function that might produce different results.
Solution:

Centralize the wallet calculation logic in one place (wallet-utils.ts).
Create a single source of truth for wallet calculations.
Update all components to use this centralized function.
Add proper error handling and logging for wallet calculations.
3. Withdrawal Processing Issues
Problem:

When an admin approves a withdrawal, the wallet balance update logic has a bug.
It's trying to access a non-existent property: selectedWithdrawal.user.wallet?.available_balance.
Evidence:

In admin-panel/app/withdrawals/page.tsx (lines 115-117), there's an incorrect reference to the wallet property.
Solution:

Fix the wallet balance update logic in the admin panel:
// Instead of:
const { error: walletError } = await supabase
  .from('wallets')
  .update({
    available_balance: selectedWithdrawal.user ? 
      (selectedWithdrawal.user as any).wallet?.available_balance - selectedWithdrawal.amount : 0
  })
  .eq('user_id', selectedWithdrawal.user_id)

// Use:
// First get the current wallet balance
const { data: walletData } = await supabase
  .from('wallets')
  .select('available_balance')
  .eq('user_id', selectedWithdrawal.user_id)
  .single()

// Then update with the correct balance
const { error: walletError } = await supabase
  .from('wallets')
  .update({
    available_balance: walletData ? 
      Math.max(0, Number(walletData.available_balance) - selectedWithdrawal.amount) : 0
  })
  .eq('user_id', selectedWithdrawal.user_id)
4. Validation Issues in Withdrawal Requests
Problem:

The validation for withdrawal requests has a logic issue that could allow withdrawing the full balance.
Line 130 in wallet-utils.ts checks if (amount >= availableBalance) which means a user can't withdraw their exact available balance.
Evidence:

In wallet-utils.ts, the validateWithdrawalRequest function has this condition.
Solution:

Update the validation logic to allow withdrawing the exact available balance:
// Instead of:
if (amount >= availableBalance) {
  return { isValid: false, error: 'Cannot withdraw the full amount. Please leave at least â‚¹1 in your account.' }
}

// Use:
if (amount > availableBalance) {
  return { isValid: false, error: 'Withdrawal amount exceeds available balance.' }
}
5. Race Condition in Wallet Updates
Problem:

Multiple components can update the wallet simultaneously, potentially causing race conditions.
The dashboard page and wallet tab both update the wallet independently.
Evidence:

In dashboard/page.tsx, there's a subscription to wallet changes.
In WalletTab.tsx, there's direct wallet update logic.
Solution:

Implement optimistic UI updates with proper error handling.
Use database transactions for critical wallet operations.
Add version control or timestamps to wallet updates to detect conflicts.
Consider using a state management library like Redux for more predictable state updates.
6. Error Handling Improvements
Problem:

Error handling is inconsistent across components.
Some errors are logged to console but not shown to users.
Evidence:

Many components have try/catch blocks that only log errors to console.
The error-handling.ts file has comprehensive utilities that aren't consistently used.
Solution:

Standardize error handling across all components using the utilities in error-handling.ts.
Implement proper user feedback for all error scenarios.
Add global error boundaries to catch and handle unexpected errors.
7. Database View Dependencies
Problem:

There are dependency issues when updating database views.
The existence of fix-view-dependencies.sql indicates this is a known issue.
Evidence:

The fix-view-dependencies.sql file contains steps to drop views in the correct order.
Solution:

Follow the steps in fix-view-dependencies.sql when updating database views.
Consider automating this process in a migration script.
Document the view dependencies for future reference.
8. Numeric Type Handling
Problem:

Inconsistent handling of numeric types between JavaScript and PostgreSQL.
Some numeric values are not properly converted to numbers.
Evidence:

In dashboard/page.tsx, there's explicit conversion of wallet numeric fields.
Similar conversions are scattered throughout the codebase.
Solution:

Create utility functions for consistent type conversion.
Ensure all numeric values from the database are properly converted to JavaScript numbers.
Add validation to prevent NaN or invalid numeric values.
9. Realtime Subscription Management
Problem:

Realtime subscriptions might not be properly cleaned up when components unmount.
This could lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.
Evidence:

In dashboard/page.tsx, there's a cleanup function for the subscription, but it might not handle all edge cases.
Solution:

Ensure all realtime subscriptions are properly cleaned up in useEffect cleanup functions.
Add error handling for subscription setup and teardown.
Consider creating a custom hook for managing Supabase subscriptions.
10. Security Improvements
Problem:

Input sanitization is not consistently applied across all user inputs.
Some API endpoints might be vulnerable to injection attacks.
Evidence:

The sanitizeInput function in validation.ts is not used in all places where user input is processed.
Solution:

Apply input sanitization consistently across all user inputs.
Implement server-side validation for all API endpoints.
Add rate limiting for sensitive operations.
Consider implementing CSRF protection.
